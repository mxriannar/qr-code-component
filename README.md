## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox


### What I learned

As a beginner, I have some difficulties with CSS stilization. This is my first Frontend Mentor challenge and I think I managed to do a good job. I didn't need any consultation.


```css
.wrapper {
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
}

.card {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    height: 550px;
    max-width: 360px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    padding: 20px;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying CSS and learn more about it. 

### Useful resources

- I am currently studying frontend at DevQuest course and it has helped me a lot with the flex box part.
